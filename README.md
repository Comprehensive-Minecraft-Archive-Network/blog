# The CMAN Blog
The Blog for all things CMAN.

# TO POST A BLOG POST:

You must have push access. All blog posts are written in Markdown. To write a blog post, use the following instructions.

1: Create a file in the _posts folder. The filename MUST be using the format "YYYY-MM-DD-CAPTION.md" (CAPTION should use hyphons (-) instead of a space)

2: Write the following Markdown into the file:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title: <Title of the blog post>
author: <Author>
---
```
This tells Jekyll that this is a blog post and it's title is what you wrote after ```title: ``` and the author is what you wrote after ```author: ```.

3: Write some blog contents. This can be anything and include Markdown.

4: Push the file. If the instructions were followed correctly, you should be able to refresh the page after around ten seconds and your post should appear.

(Note: The reason why I used colons instead of periods is because Markdown keeps messing up and making steps 3 and 4 to be 1 and 2)
