# The CMAN Blog
The Blog for all things CMAN.

# TO POST A BLOG POST:

You must have push access. All blog posts are written in Markdown. To write a blog post, use the following instructions.

1. Create a file in the _posts folder. The filename MUST be using the format "YYYY-MM-DD-CAPTION.md" (CAPTION should use hyphons (-) instead of a space)
2. The first bit of the file should be:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title: <Title of the blog post>
---
```
This tells Jekyll that this is a blog post and it's title is <Title of the blog post>.
3. Write some blog contents. This can be anything and include Markdown.

4. Push the file. If the instructions were followed correctly, you should be able to refresh the page after around ten seconds and your post should appear.
